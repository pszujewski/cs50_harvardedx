# Harvard's CS50

## Why take this course?

My primary motivation for taking this course was to deepen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and how computers work in general. The primary questions I was interested in addressing included:

* How is memory allocated to programs?
* Having worked primarily in JavaScript, what does it mean to 'compile' a program? Also, what concretely is the difference between a 'compiled' language and an 'interpreted' language?
* More generally, I was interested in seeing if learning the basics of a 'lower-level' language such as C might help me better understand how to more effectively write code in JavaScript. For example, I was curious to see if exploring C (nd particularly the notion of 'pointers') would help me better understand the difference between mutable and immutable data types in JavaScript.

## Disclaimer
This repo contains all of the files for the problem sets I completed as a part of this course. However, I did not write all of the code herein. Normally, it should be pretty clear what I wrote and what I did not. Please note that the inclusion of the files I did not edit/ write is for my own personal notes.

## Topics covered by problem set

### Problem sets 1 - 5
C Programming Language
clang and compilers overview
Data types in C
ASCII
Arrays & Memory
Big-O Notation and measuring algorithm run-time
Promgram memory (i.e the stack vs. the heap)
Pointers and 'addresses' in memory
Memory leaks and the use of valgrind
Algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, and Binary Search in particular
Data structures: Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Tries, Trees, and Binary Search Tress in particular

### Problem set 6 and 7
Python, SQL and HTTP
The MVC pattern or framework
Python web servers and the Flask micro-framework
Python features, such as lists, dicts, and tuples
Joins and SQL CRUD operations with a focus on sqlite3

## Lecture notes

Each lecture consisted of about 2 hours on edx. My notes, organized according to each lecture, follow below.

### Lecture 1

**Introduction**
The basis of Computer science is input and outputs and problem solving. Between the inputs and outputs are the algorithms.

A note on The Binary system
A single number in binary is a bit. 8 bits makes a byte.
Transistors are millions of switches that turn on and off that represent lots and lots of zeros and ones.

A note on ASCII
The world decided that certain decimal numbers (reflected in binary) would express letters -> IE H is 72
Mapping binary numbers to letters is ASCII

A note on the concept of 'threading'
Multi-threading literally allows you to do multiple things at the same time. Programs can be multi-threaded. A thread is one thing a computer can do.
