# Harvard's CS50

## Why take this course?

My primary motivation for taking this course was to deepen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and how computers work in general. The primary questions I was interested in addressing included:

* How is memory allocated to programs?
* Having worked primarily in JavaScript, what does it mean to 'compile' a program? Also, what concretely is the difference between a 'compiled' language and an 'interpreted' language?
* More generally, I was interested in seeing if learning the basics of a 'lower-level' language such as C might help me better understand how to more effectively write code in JavaScript. For example, I was curious to see if exploring C (nd particularly the notion of 'pointers') would help me better understand the difference between mutable and immutable data types in JavaScript.

## Disclaimer
This repo contains all of the files for the problem sets I completed as a part of this course. However, I did not write all of the code herein. Normally, it should be pretty clear what I wrote and what I did not. Please note that the inclusion of the files I did not edit/ write is for my own personal notes.

## Topics covered by problem set

### Problem sets 1 - 5
* C Programming Language
* Clang and compilers overview
* Data types in C
* ASCII
* Arrays & Memory
* Big-O Notation and measuring algorithm run-time
* Promgram memory (i.e the stack vs. the heap)
* Pointers and 'addresses' in memory
* Memory leaks and the use of valgrind
* Algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, and Binary Search in particular
* Data structures: Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Tries, Trees, and Binary Search Tress in particular

### Problem set 6 and 7
* Python, SQL and HTTP
* The MVC pattern or framework
* Python web servers and the Flask micro-framework
* Python features, such as lists, dicts, and tuples
* Joins and SQL CRUD operations with a focus on sqlite3

## Lecture notes

Each lecture consisted of about 2 hours on edx. My notes, organized according to each lecture, can be found in each pset directory.

Thanks!
